            "back": "Child labor presents a double standard compared to education. 1. It’s OK for kids to be bored and uncomfortable at school, but not at work. 2. It’s OK for kids to devote every spare minute to sports, music, drama, or chess, but not work. 3. Employers 'exploit' kids if they pay them a low wage, but schools don’t 'exploit' students by paying them a negative wage (charging tuition).",

The Ph.D. education is an important edge case which Caplan does not deal with. One might guess at outcomes for this class of person by extrapolating trends among the lower classes, or by looking at outcomes for an above average excellent student.",
