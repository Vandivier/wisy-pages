In such cases there may be no particular 'will of the people' because multiple outcomes can result. In the extreme case, all possible outcomes result with an equal probability. Such problematic theoretical results are empirically rare. There is strong empirical evidence that many outomes are strongly explained by the single-dimensional liberal-conservative policy spectrum, so the MVT is a useful first-pass explanation, guide, or tool.",
