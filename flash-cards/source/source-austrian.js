That is, they are originally unintended. 3) They can be meaningfully described as orders. That is, there is an identifiable pattern made up of related parts. 4) They are self-reinforcing. 5) The human elements of the order follow rules of conduct which may be formal or informal. 6) Spontaneous orders are abstract objects. Individuals within the order do not need to understand the order or even be aware of its existance.",

            "back": "Subjectivism has been the main theory of value in economics since the marginal revolution in the late 1800s. It holds that value is subjectively determined rather than based, for example, on the input labor required. Radical subjectivism, in contrast, is a kaleidic theory based on the work of the Austrian Ludwige Lachmann and developed by the Post-Keynesian George Shackle from the mid to late 1900s. This theory holds that individuals and markets may not predictably be heading toward an equilibrium state. It argues this by identifying 1) uncertainty as non-endogenizable and 2) ends or preferences as dynamic, and not necessarily moving in any particular direction.",

            "front": "What are three traits peculiar to Austrian Economics?",
            "back": "1) The school's approach to process and knowledge. Equilibrium is not viewed as a thing to be obtained and instead the process of equilibration is emphasized. This process is seen as proceeding according to individual action. This principle is identified as methodological individualism. Multi-specific knowledge or belief sets are key in this view, as is the role of uncertainty. 2) The school's emphasis on entrepreneurship. Mises and Hayek emphasized the role of the entrepreneus as an arbitrageur. Kirzner emphasized the entrepreneur taking risk under uncertainty, aided by alertness. Schumpeter emphasized the entrepreneur-as-inventor. Neoclassical theory views an entrepreneur as a search specialist. Austrians dominate the field of entrepreneurial economic theory, in a niche way. 3) The multi-specific nature of the world. Austrians led the adoption of heterogeneity into analysis, but mainstream economics has picked that up. What they have yet to pick up, except game theory, is the critically multi-specific nature of capital, goods, and the world. Even game theory owes to the Austrians as it was founded by von Neumann and Morgenstern, where Austrians influenced them both. Mises, for example, was Morgenstern's doctoral advisor.",
